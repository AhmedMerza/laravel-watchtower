How Watchtower behaves at the edges: behind proxies, during a cache outage, and on the wire between environments.

**Trusted proxies:** Watchtower checks `$request->ip()` in a global middleware registered directly after Laravel's `TrustProxies`, so the forwarded client IP has already been resolved. It still runs before sessions, auth and routing. If your app is behind a load balancer or proxy, configure trusted proxies (`$middleware->trustProxies(at: ...)` in `bootstrap/app.php`), otherwise every request looks like it comes from the proxy. If you've removed `TrustProxies` from the global stack, Watchtower runs first and sees the direct peer address.

**Cache outages fail open:** if the cache store throws during the lookup, the request is let through unchecked rather than returning a 500. The failure is logged on `watchtower.log_channel` roughly once a minute, and the cache warm-up stands down for the same window, so an outage can't fill the disk with one log line per request. The throttle window is kept in marker files under `storage/framework/`; on a read-only filesystem it degrades to per-process throttling. The check isn't atomic, so requests already in flight when an outage starts can each log once before the window closes — expect a small burst at onset, then one line per minute.

**HMAC signatures:** Sync requests are signed by the satellite and verified by the master. The signature is `hash_hmac('sha256', timestamp + METHOD + path + rawBody, WATCHTOWER_SYNC_SECRET)`, sent as `X-Watchtower-Signature` alongside `X-Watchtower-Timestamp`; `Watchtower\Support\SyncSignature` is the one implementation both ends use. The master compares with `hash_equals` and rejects anything unsigned, wrongly signed, or carrying a timestamp more than `sync.timestamp_tolerance` seconds (default 300) from its own clock, which bounds how long a captured request stays replayable. Method and path are inside the signed string, so a captured read can't be replayed as a write. Use a long, random secret and keep it identical across environments.

**Cache TTL:** Each per-IP cache entry carries a 24-hour TTL (configurable via `cache.ttl_hours`) as a safety net. The cache is explicitly rebuilt on every block/unblock and on `watchtower:sync`; if the store is flushed or its entries expire, the next lookup warms it from the DB.
